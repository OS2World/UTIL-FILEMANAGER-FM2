:h2 res=95500 name=PANEL_SETICON.System Pointer Manipulation
This dialog is reached from the context menu of the icon in a file system
object Information dialog.
:p.
Set the radio button of the system pointer you want to change. Then
click Okay. Click Cancel to abort if you change your mind.
:p.
Changes to system pointers are persistent (they stick around even when
FM/2 is no longer running).
