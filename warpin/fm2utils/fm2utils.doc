    ================================================================

This is a collection of utilities that may prove useful in conjunction
with FM/2 (or even without it).

All the .EXE utilities provide help if you run them with /? as an
argument (hint:  arguments shown in brackets [] are optional, arguments
shown in braces <> are required).  The .CMD utilities may be directly
inspected using a text editor and are commented as to use and function.
It's recommended that you place these utilities into a directory on your
PATH (type HELP PATH at a command prompt if you don't know what that
means).  If you have FM/2 installed, may I suggest you make a UTILS
directory off your FM/2 directory (the FM/2 INSTALL.CMD assumes you
will, and will make some program objects for you)?

These utilities are standalone, meaning that one doesn't rely on
another.  You can therefore delete any you don't want to keep around
without affecting the operation of any of the others.

If you like the FM/2 Utilities package, you'll love FM/2.  File
Manager/2 (FM/2) is a shareware OS/2 2.1+ PM 32-bit
file/directory/archive maintenance utility (a sort of super-Drives
object, something midway between the Drives objects and a more
traditional file manager) with plenty of bells, whistles and utilities,
drag and drop, context menus, toolbars and accelerator keys.  FM/2 won a
1995 OS/2 Magazine Editor's Choice award -- the only file management
software to do so.  If you know how to use OS/2, you already know how to
use most of FM/2.  You can easily glean the rest from the extensive
online help.  FM/2 is available from ftp.secret.com (/g/os2utl), from
Compuserve's OS2SHARE (OS2BVEN) forum (GO OS2SHARE) in library 18, and
from finer OS/2 BBSs everywhere.


Following is a very brief description of each program in the package:

BEEP.EXE
    Makes a beep noise.

CRC.EXE
    Calculates and prints the CRC of a file or files.

CVT4OS2.CMD
    Converts 4DOS/4OS2 non-standard DESCRIPT.ION files to WPS-standard
    .SUBJECT EAs (see comments in program).

CVTFBBS.CMD
    Converts FILES.BBS file comments to WPS-standard .SUBJECT EAs (see
    comments in program).

DELTREE.EXE
    Deletes a directory and all its subdirectories and files.

DRVRLIST.EXE
    Lists all mounted drivers.  Use /w switch for a "wide" listing.

DRVTYPES.EXE
    Lists all drives with information on their types.

DSTART.EXE
    A START command that will work from DOS VDMs (penalty box).

EA.EXE
    An extended attribute manipulation program.  Can be used to zap all
    the EAs from REXX .CMD files.

EJECT.EXE
    Eject media from a removable drive.  Notes:  when EJECT, LOCK or
    UNLOCK returns an error code of 31, it usually means that function
    is not supported for the requested drive.  "The parameter is not
    correct" may mean you tried it on a non-existent or fixed drive.
    Error 163 is not in the OS/2 message file; it's "uncertain media,"
    and usually just repeating the command will "fix" it.

FATOPT.EXE*
    An OS/2 FAT optimizer -- defragment, condense freespaces, sort file
    and directory names, test sectors in system areas, test (and repair
    some damaged) clusters, report on drive usage.  If you receive a
    "FATOpt can't lock" message from FATOpt, the drive is in use and
    FATOpt can't optimize it; try booting from floppies (place
    FATOPT.EXE on the floppy together with VIOCALLS.DLL).  If you
    receive a "FATOpt ran out of memory" error, add RAM and/or set up a
    swapfile on a partition other than the one being optimized (type
    HELP SWAPPATH at a command line for more info) and/or try the -p
    or -q switches.  Other errors (uncommon) should be self-explanatory,
    if distressing.  CHKDSK/F should be run before running FATOpt, and
    it's always a good idea to back up before defragging.  FATOpt
    errorlevel returns for batch files:  0 = no problems, 1 = user
    abort, 2 = out of memory, 3 = bad file (run CHKDSK/F, dammit),
    4 = can't open drive, 5 = can't lock drive, 6 = can't fix bad
    cluster, 7 = insufficient free space on drive, 8 = unknown error,
    9 = bad system area, 10 = error during standard file copy.
    BACKUP BEFORE OPTIMIZING.  REMEMBER THE BEST OPTIMIZATION IS
    ACCOMPLISHED BY A BACKUP/DELETE/RESTORE.

FINDPATH.EXE
    List a PATH-style environment variable's directories (or LIBPATH),
    or find a file or files in those directories.  Perhaps useful for
    tracking down files that appear in more than one directory on the
    PATH or LIBPATH.

FLUSH.EXE
    Flush file system caches and buffers (make system quiescent).

FM2PLAY.EXE*
    Used by FM/2 to play multimedia files with the "Play Multimedia"
    command (requires MMPM/2).

HPFSOPT.EXE*
    An HPFS optimizer.

ICONIFY.EXE
    "Iconifies" image files, which is to say that it sets the icon
    of image files to be miniature versions of the image files.  A
    PM program, but designed to be run in batch mode from a command
    line.

IMAGE.EXE*
    Used by FM/2 to quickly display image files (requires MMPM/2).
    Request a context menu for several options.

ISTEXT.EXE
    Returns ERRORLEVEL 1 if a file appears to be a text (ASCII) file,
    0 if not or file is inaccessible.

KILL2.EXE
    A timed deletion/touch/list utility.

KILLPID.EXE
    Kill processes by PID or title, or list PIDs of running processes.
    See also SWITCHTO.EXE.

KEYLOCKS.EXE
    Control state of num lock, caps lock, scroll lock.  Note:  PM
    program, but still designed to be run from command line.

LA.EXE
    Lists the contents of archive files, extracts files from archives
    using one command without you having to know the archive type or
    archiver commands (requires ARCHIVER.BB2 datafile to be on your
    PATH or DPATH, copy included in the archive, edit to taste/need).

LINES.EXE
    Counts lines in text files.

LOCK.EXE
    Lock a removable drive.

    Make directories many levels deep with one command.

MOV.EXE

    overwriting.

    objects from a command).

NOCAD.EXE
    Disables/reenables (toggles) CTRL-ALT-DEL.

OPEN.EXE
    Opens a WPS object or website.

PRIORITY.EXE
    A launch-with-priority program that lets you set the priority of
    other programs when you start them.

PTREE.EXE
    Displays the tree of a given path, several options.

QFORMAT.EXE
    Quick format floppies by zapping the root and FATs.  NOTE:  Warp's
    FORMAT will do this now, too (/Q switch).

QPLAY.EXE
    Quiet play plays multimedia files via MMPM/2 without showing itself
    (perhaps useful from batch files).

REBOOT.EXE
    Reboots the system as though you'd pressed CTRL-ALT-DEL.

REBOOTP.EXE
    Reboots the system as though you'd pressed CTRL-ALT-DEL after
    broadcasting a WM_QUIT message to all children of the desktop and
    waiting 60 seconds for the applications to save their settings and
    quit (note that VIO and DOS applications will pop up their "Are you
    sure?" boxes, but you don't have to be there to answer (and
    shouldn't be -- use Shutdown instead if you're not automating),
    though such apps won't pick up on the hint to shut down).  This is a
    PM application, but still designed to be run from command line.

    Set screen modes (columns, rows, resolutions) for VIO/full screen
    sessions or reports on available modes.

SNAPSHOT.EXE
