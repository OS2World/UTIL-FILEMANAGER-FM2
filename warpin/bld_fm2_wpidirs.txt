;
;  This is a file which will be used to automate the process of incorporating new files,
;  directories and/or packages into the Warpin WPI file.
;
;  The format of this file is as follows:
;     -  All blank lines are ignored
;     -  For any lines which contain a semicolon (like all the
;        lines so far), the semicolon and any text on the line
;        following the semicolon are ignored (i.e. they are
;        comments mean for humans reading the file)
;     -  All lines which have non-blank text which does not
;        follow a semicolon, must be in one of the following
;        formats:
;           PACKAGECOUNT: <number-of-packages>
;           PACKAGE: <package-number>  <package-description>
;           FILE: <name>  <pkg-num> <src-dir> <dest-dir>
;           DUMMYFILE: <name>  <pkg-num> <dest-dir>
;        where
;           <number-of-packages> is the total number of packages
;           <package-number> is package number being described
;           <package-description> is a free-form textual description of the package
;           <name> is a file name (without any path information>
;           <pkg-num> is the number of the package to which this file belongs
;           <src-dir> is the directory, relative to the base (or top) of the build subtree.
;              NOTE: If you run BLD_FM2_WPIDIRS using an unzipped distribution of FM/2
;              instead of the FM/2 source code build subtree, then <src_dir> is ignored.
;              (See BLD_FM2_WPI.README for how to use an unzipped distribution of FM/2.)
;           <dest-dir> is the directory, relative to the base (or top) of the
;              directory selected by the user during an install, into which this file
;              should be installed.
;        NOTE: There can be any number of spaces (except 0) between the various parameters
;        NOTE: A dot. '.', for src-dir or dest-dir means the base/top directory of the
;           subtree.
;
;     -  The PACKAGECOUNT line should be before all PACKAGE, FILE and DUMMYFILE lines
;     -  All the PACKAGE lines should be before all FILE and DUMMYFILE lines
;     -  The FILE and DUMMYFILE lines should be after the PACKAGECOUNT and PACKAGE
;        line. They may be intermixed with each other. As seen below, they have been
;        grouped by package. This is not necessary but it will make it easier find
;        lines that need to be changed.
;
;     NOTE: Warpin scripts do not require that the package numbers are consecutive. For
;     example a script may have four packages which are numbered 1, 4, 12 and 293. For
;     this script, this file should have:
;        PACKAGECOUNT: 4               ; NOT 293!!
;        And then all the package numbers on the PACKAGE, FILE and DUMMYFILE lines would
;        be 1, 4, 12, or 293.
;
;     NOTE: DUMMYFILE's are used because Warpin currently does not allow packages which
;     do not include a least one file to install. DUMMYFILE's are created dynamically
;     as needed during the build process (which is why no src-dir is specified).
