;  Change log:
;	23 Feb 08 JBS: Added lines for debugging support package (#10)
;	28 Oct 08 JBS: Added lines for new icons (ticket 294)
;       04 Feb 09 SHL: Drop fm3res.str
;
;  This is a file which will be used to simplify the process of
;     -  incorporating new files
;     -  renaming files
;     -  discontinuing obsolete files
;     -  relocation of files within the build subtree
;     -  relocation of files within the installation subtree
;     -  incorporating new build subtree directories
;     -  incorporating new installation subtree directories
;     -  discontinuing obsolete installation subtree directories
;     -  incorporating new packages
;     -  renumbering packages
;     -  discontinuing obsolete packages
;  into the Warpin WPI file. All of these changes can be accomplished without
;  modification of the warpin makefile. Just make any necessary changes within
;  the build subtree and change this file accordingly. The next FM2.WPI created
;  by NMAKE DIST will reflect these changes.
;
;  The format of this file is as follows:
;     -  All blank lines are ignored
;     -  For any lines which contain a semicolon (like all the lines so far),
;        the semicolon and any text on the line following the semicolon are
;        ignored (i.e. they are comments meant for humans reading the file)
;     -  All lines which have non-blank text which does not follow a semicolon,
;        must be in one of the following formats:
;           FILE: <name>  <package-number> <src-dir> <dest-dir>
;           NOFILESPACKAGE: <package-number>
;        where
;           <name> is a file name (without any path information>
;           <package-number> is a package number
;           <src-dir> is the directory, relative to the base (or top) of the build subtree.
;              NOTE: If you run BLD_FM2_WPIDIRS using an unzipped distribution of FM/2
;              instead of the FM/2 source code build subtree, then <src_dir> is ignored.
;              (See BLD_FM2_WPI.README for how to use an unzipped distribution of FM/2.)
;           <dest-dir> is the directory, relative to the base (or top) of the
;              directory selected by the user during an install, into which this file
;              should be installed.
;        NOTE: There can be any number of spaces (except 0) between the various parameters
;        NOTE: A dot, '.', for src-dir or dest-dir means the base/top directory of the
;           subtree.
;
;     -  The order of the FILE and NOFILESPACKAGE lines is not important but it will
;        facilitate future changes if files for each package are grouped together.
;
;     NOTE: Warpin scripts do not require that the package numbers are consecutive.
