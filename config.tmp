; Fixed: Ticket 267
;
;This file contains some utility definitions for the FM/2 toolbar.
;FM/2 saved this file as "<DRIVE>:\FM2\CONFIG.TLS".
;
;Each tool button has four lines that describe it.  The first line is
;the help for the button.
;
;The second line is the text for the button (internally defined tools
;have icons, and the text is ignored).
;
;The third line is a number indicating flags associated with the button.
;A flag value of 0 means the button is non-droppable, 1 means the button
;is droppable, 4 means invisible (5 both), 8 means non-droppable with a
;spacer following, and 9 means droppable with a spacer following.
;
;The fourth line is the ID of the button (for internal commands only).
;Note Commands begin at ID 4000, so a button with ID 4000 would cause
;the first Command to be run and ID 4001 would run the second, and so on.
;4900 marks the first "quick toolbox change" item, and you can
;have up to 50 of them (these buttons load other toolboxes, see
;online help).
;
;You can use \r in the help string to break the help into multiple lines.
