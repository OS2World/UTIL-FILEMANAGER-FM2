FM/2 3.07 has had changes made to its ini file structure.
These changes mean that the ini file is not backward 
compatible. Please backup you FM3.INI file before installing
so you can revert to an earlier version without losing some 
of your customizations. Please note you need to leave a copy
of the fm3.ini file in the install directory in order to keep your 
customizations in 3.07. The temp file fm3.!!! will not update 
the new ini as it is only used when fm2 is running.

File Manager/2 (FM/2) starting with version 3.6 is being 
built with OpenWatcom. Changing compilers can introduce 
unexpected problem so you may want to backup your current
install, or at minimum have a working copy of the FM/2 
version 3.5.9 warpin available for reinstall if problems arise.
To backup your current install simple zip up your install
directory with its subdirectories or copy them to a different
location.To restore simply copy the old FM/2 back to the 
its original location. Remember you can't use the new FM/2
to do this since if it is running some files will be locked
and won't be replaced. If you didn't backup and need to go
back just install the 3.5.9 warpin package over the new 
install. It will warn you that the install is newer but just
tell it to install anyway. The warpin install process is 
designed to save all your customizations. Don't delete the 
new install if you don't have a backup since this will result 
in the loss of any custom changes you have made. If you need 
to delete it to get the reinstall to work. Backup up the new 
install and then copy the *.bmp, *.tls, *.dat, *.cmd & *.ini 
files back to the install directory after the reinstall. 
Don't copy the *.str files as they are version specific. 
If you have problems be sure to report it (See Support
at the end of this file).    

File Manager/2 (FM/2) is a free OS/2(Warp)/eCS Presentation
Manager 32-bit file/directory/archive maintenance utility
(a sort of super-Drives object, something midway between the
Drives objects and a more traditional file manager) with plenty
of bells, whistles and utilities, drag and drop, context menus,
toolbars, bubble help and accelerator keys. If you know how
to use OS/2, you already know how to use most of FM/2. You
can easily glean the rest from the extensive online help,
including tutorials.

This document explains how to install FM/2, including
upgrading from previous versions. It explains command line
syntaxes (parameters in a program object) and how to get the
program(s) running. The online help tells you how to
actually use FM/2. I'll try to keep this brief.

FM/2 3.x installation instructions:
==================================

Pre-requisite:
   WarpIN 0.9.20 or higher must be installed.

Install (or re-install) from a FM/2 ZIP file distribution
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the FM2*.ZIP archive in a private directory (for
example, C:\TMP). (UNZIP.EXE works nicely to unpack the
file.) Two WPI files, FM2.WPI and FM2UTILS.WPI will be
unzipped.

2. Follow the instructions for installing from WPI file(s)
below.


Install (or re-install) from a FM/2 WPI file distribution
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the WPS folder containing the WPI file(s).

2. Double click on FM2.WPI. Since WarpIN associates itself
with WPI files this will start WarpIN with FM2.WPI as the
parameter.

3, You may then install FM/2 to a directory of your choice
and, if FM2UTILS.WPI is present, install FM/2 Utilities to
a directory of your choice.

NOTE: If you double click on FM2UTILS.WPI instead of
FM2.WPI, you will only be able to install the FM/2
Utilities. It is recommended that, even if you only want to
install FM/2 Utilities, that you do so using FM2.WPI.


Moving FM/2 and/or FM/2 Utilities:
----------------------------------

1. Copy your existing installation directory to the new
location.

2. If you have added your own icons to any of the FM/2
folders, then you should move them elsewhere temporarily.

3. Follow the instructions for de-installing below.

4. Re-install the package using the installation
instructions above. This will update the WarpIN database and
reset your icons to the new locations.

5. Move the icons you saved in step #2, back into the FM/2
folders if you wish.


De-installing FM/2 and/or FM/2 Utilities:
-----------------------------------------

1. Run Warpin without parameters.

2. Right click on a package you want to de-install and
select "de-install all packages".

3. Click on OK in the "De-install Packages" window that
appears.



=================
First-time notes:
=================

Starting FM/2 -- how it works, customizing parameters:

If you start File Manager/2 (filename FM3.EXE) with no
parameters, it opens the Drive Tree window but no directory
windows (unless the "Save state of dir windows" toggle is
checked -- see online help).

File Manager/2 optionally accepts names of directories in
the parameters field of its program object; it'll open a
directory window for each one. Hint: If you often do
different specific things with FM/2, you might set up a WPS
object customized to start up ideally for each activity. For
example, if you wanted to maintain your BBS areas, you might
have one object with parameters like: "D:\BBSDIR
D:\BBSDIR\MAILIN D:\BBSDIR\MAILOUT", and if you also like to
use FM/2 to set icons on files, you might have another
object with parameters like: "E:\MYICONS D:\NEWFILES". The
State quicklist can also be used for this within FM/2 itself
-- see online help.

You can exclude drives in the parameters by prefacing the
drive letter with "/", and there can be more than one drive
letter behind the "/" (i.e. "/BH" to exclude both drives B:
and H:). Hint: Many people like to use /B to exclude
"phantom" drive B: if they have a single-floppy system.
Similarly, you can cause drives NOT to be prescanned by the
Drive Tree by prefacing the drive letter with ";", drives
NOT to load icons for objects by prefacing the drive letter
with ",", drives NOT to load subjects for objects by
prefacing the drive letter with "`" and drives NOT to load
longnames for objects by prefacing the drive letter with
"'". This can be handy if you have a very slow drive like a
CD-ROM or Zip drive. FM/2 Lite recognizes these switches,
too. See also the Drive Flags dialog in FM/2.

If you place the plus sign "+" (alone, separated from
anything else by spaces) in the parameters, FM/2 will log,
to FM2.LOG, delete, rename, move and copy operations that
are performed by drag-and-drop or with the menus. FM/2 Lite
recognizes this switch, too.

The parameter "-" (alone, separated from anything else by
spaces) causes FM/2 to ignore, not load or save, the
previous state of directory windows (see the "Save state of
dir windows" toggle under Config Menu->Toggles in the online
help) for that invocation.

You can specify the name of an alternate INI file with
"-<inifilename>" -- for example: "-C:\FM2\MYINI.INI".

You can also specify the INI file location with the
environment variable FM2INI -- for example:
   SET FM2INI=C:\FM2\MYINI.INI.


------------------------------
How to get started using FM/2:
-----------------------------
Please read the following sections in the online help when
you start FM/2 for the first time: "How to use FM/2's Help,"
"Terminology" and "General Help," then "Hints." A peek at
the labelled "Window Layouts" pictures would probably be a
good idea, too. The rest you can browse as you get time/feel
the need; for instance, if you want to know what a toggle
does, read the help under Settings notebook for that page
(each Settings notebook page has its own Help button).

If you prefer hard copy help, print this file, run FM/2,
press F1, click the "Print" button at the bottom (IBM View)
or top (Newview)of the help window that appears and then print
both the "Contents" and "All sections" (keep an eye on the printer,
after page 100 of "All sections" as the Help Manager will
begin printing its own help then -- you may want to abort
printing at that point). Advanced and/or curious users may
also want to print FM3TOOLS.DAT and ARCHIVER.BB2. Be sure
you have plenty of paper and ink handy -- the package is
well documented. You'll probably also want a three-ring
binder and hole punch to get it bound, as staples aren't
going through that puppy. You can, of course, print only the
sections that are of particular interest to you.

Additional documentation:

Look in the FM/2 Docs subfolder of the File Manager/2 folder
for easy access to all documentation.


Bonus programs:
==============

You'll note the extra objects that the Install program
creates in the FM/2 Tools subfolder of the File Manager/2
folder. FM/2 is modular, so that you can get directly to
some of its components without running the entire ball of
wax. This may allow you to enhance the behavior of some of
your other applications in the WPS tradition. You don't
_have_ to keep these around, of course -- FM/2 itself
contains all their functionality.

ARCHIVE VIEWER/2: Intended for drag-and-drop operation (or
WPS association) with WPS objects or other applications.
Drag an archive onto it, drop it, get an archive listing
box. FM/2's installation program sets up some associations
between archive files and this program by file extension.
AV/2 will try to display whatever you give it as
sensibly as it can. Filename AV2.EXE.

EA VIEWER: Drag a file system object onto it and it'll show
you the object's extended attributes. Filename EAS.EXE.

INI VIEWER: Drag an .INI file onto it and it'll show you its
contents. Filename INI.EXE.

BOOKSHELF VIEWER: Shows all .INF files in a listbox and lets
you pick the one(s) you want to view. If you give any
command line argument, the .HLP files on the HELP path will
be shown instead (the Helpfile Viewer object calls
VIEWINFS.EXE with "dummy" for an argument, for example).
Filename VIEWINFS.EXE.

PROCESS KILLER: Lets you kill off renegade processes. An
English version of PSTAT.EXE must be on your PATH. Filename
KILLPROC.EXE.

UNDELETER: Lets you undelete files (via interface with
UNDELETE.COM). Drag a file system object onto it and it'll
let you undelete files for that drive. Filename UNDEL.EXE.

VISUAL TREE: Opens a Drive Tree window (like the WPS Drives
object with more horsepower). Filename VTREE.EXE.

VISUAL DIRECTORY: Opens a Directory Container window; drag a
file system object onto it and this will open its directory
(like a WPS directory Folder with more horsepower). Filename
VDIR.EXE.

COLLECTOR: Opens a Collector window. Filename VCOLLECT.EXE.
Two other objects, "See all files" and "Seek and scan" are
created which call up the Collector and go directly to
dialogs for the appropriate purpose.

GLOBAL VIEWER: Opens a global view of a drive or drives.
Filename GLOBAL.EXE.

DATABAR: Opens a databar showing some system information.
Filename DATABAR.EXE.

DIRSIZE: Shows where drive usage is concentrated. Filename
DIRSIZE.EXE.

FM/2 LITE: A simplified interface for "dummies." Filename
FM4.EXE.

FM/2's install creates FM2.CMD, AV2.CMD, VDIR.CMD,
VTREE.CMD, VCOLLECT.CMD, UNDEL.CMD, KILLPROC.CMD, INI.CMD,
EAS.CMD, DIRSIZE.CMD, VIEWINFS.CMD and VIEWHELP.CMD files
for you in a directory "utils" off the install directory.
You should add this directory to your PATH= statement in
CONFIG.SYS (type HELP PATH at a command line for more info).
If you prefer, FM/2's INSTALL builds a SETENV.CMD in the
FM/2 directory which you can call to set the PATH for FM/2
in any given session without modifying CONFIG.SYS.


Troubleshooting:
===============

FM/2 seems much slower than previous versions. 
The Find Buffer in FM/2 has been reworked to make it user
settable in more place and significantly enlarge it. This 
significantly increases the loading speed for large directories
However, most users will need to reset the buffer by going 
to the settings notebook scanning page and setting FindBuf.
The new default for clean installs is 10240. We recommend you
change to this setting (or higher) unless you have very limited
hardware (less than 32 meg of memory original Pentium or earlier).

If FM/2 won't run, the probable culprit is CONFIG.SYS. Your
LIBPATH statement should contain a ".;" entry. If yours
doesn't, add it. It's standard for an OS/2 installation, but
some buggy install programs knock it out because they
translate entries to their full pathname before rewriting
(so ".;" gets translated to whatever the current directory
is for the buggy install program). What this ".;" entry does
is allow a program to find and use .DLL files in the
program's current directory -- obviously something you want
programs to be able to do, otherwise you'd have to put every
application's .DLLs into directories already on the LIBPATH,
or add the directories of all applications to the LIBPATH, a
rather huge pain in the, uh, neck.

If things in FM/2 are suddenly acting strange after an
upgrade, first check the integrity of the install using
using WarpIN. If it shows a problem rerun the install
package. If that fails try installing to a new directory
or backup your existing directory so you can save any changes
you made to the template files then uninstall and reinstall.
Once you have FM/2 working migrate the *.ini, *.dat, *.tls,
*.bb2 and *.cmd from your old install/backup to recover your
custom settings

If the "FM/2 Online Help" object in the "FM/2 Docs"
subfolder won't work properly, you've got a version of
VIEW.EXE that won't directly display help (.HLP) files. Use
SEEHELP.EXE from the FM/2 Utilities package to get around
this problem (or upgrade your version of OS/2).

Don't drag files over Netscape -- it will lock up if files
(not WPS objects; there's a subtle difference) are dragged
over it.

If you get a popup dialog that needs to be reported to the
maintainer, you can either take a screen shot or you can
capture the information from STDERR with:

  FM3 2>STDERR.LOG

This technique works for all the FM/2, FM/2 Lite and all the
standalone applets.

If you are having trouble with Drag and Drop operations, try
the + command line switch described above. The content of
FM2.LOG may be helpful.


Known problems/shortcomings:
===========================

- FM/2 does not properly report sizes of some files with
long name resident on Win95/NT drives.

- File List Container fails to fill after drive change
SYS0039 error.

- Tree switching on Focus/Directory Change appears to be
slower than expected.

- Access to LS120 and FAT32 drives may be slower than expected

- Icon display in Directory Container does not always match
WPS icons

- Spurious WPS Objects Handles may be created during some
operations

- Trying to run Global.exe from the command line in 4OS2 
(perhaps other shells) results in the execution of 4OS2's "Global" 
command. Global.exe can be run by placing it in quotes or 
prefixing it with *. See 4OS2's documentation for more information.

- As with any OS/2 program significant changes (such as our 
change to OpenWatcom) will result in the incompatibility of 
older (VAC) exes with new dlls and vice versa. Attempting to run
OpenWatcom exes with a VAC dll loaded in memory or in your 
libpath ahead of the new version will result in a SYS3175 in 
popuplog.os2. The reverse gives a SYS2070. If you experience these
problems search your libpath for fm3dll.dll and remove or rename 
it. Your libpath should have "." (without the quotes) as your 
first entry to minimize the likelihood of this problem. FM/2's 
installer does not add the FM/2 directory to the libpath.

currently active bugs
