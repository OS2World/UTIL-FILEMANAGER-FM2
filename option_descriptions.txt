;
; This file is read by ReleaseEdit.cmd so that it can build the
; "option description" lines from scratch.
;
; The format of this file should be fairly evident. The descriptions
; (the last part of "option description", following the '@@') are of
; the form:
; 	desc.<relative-def-filename-without-.DEF>
; So the description for av2.def starts with:
;       desc.av2=
; and the description for dll\fm3dll.def starts with:
;       desc.dll\fm3dll=
;
; EVERY def file needs an entry for the description in this file.
;
; NOTE: In the copyright portion of the description, use the
; string "copyright-year" as a placeholder for the current year.
; ReleaseEdit with replace it with the current year.
;
; NOTE: If a description requires a '&', then ReleaseEdit.cmd
; will have to be modified to use a different separator for the
; SED find and replace strings! (Search for "sed_separator".)
;
; Lines which do not start with desc. are "global" (i.e. they will
; apply to ALL def files. All of these "global" fields have defaults
; which ReleaseEdit will use. Certain "global" fields in the option
; description are omitted because their default values are unlikely
; to change:
;   asd_feature_id: <null>
;   build/file version: 0
;   fixpack_ver: <null>
; These defaults can be overriddem by adding appropriate lines to this file.
;
; An value may be set to the current setting of an environment variable.
; See "buildhost" below for an example.
;
; If there are duplicate entries (e.g. two desc.databar lines), then
; the LAST one will be used. So keep these comments up front so they
; will not be used mistakenly by ReleaseEdit.cmd.
;
; Case is significant to the right of the equals sign (except for
; environment variable names) and insignificant to the left of the equals sign.
