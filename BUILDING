Building FM/2
=============

This document explains how to build FM/2 from source.

Tools
=====

The following tools are currently used to build the FM/2 binaries

  OpenWatcom v1.6 or newer
  IBM Developers Toolkit v4.5
  lxlite LX compressor

Older versions of the Toolkit may work.  The OpenWatcom implementation of 
the Toolkit should work, but this has not been fully verified.  There are no 
known special setup requirements. 

Not all versions of RC.EXE are created equal.  Currently, the best version to
use is

 12-18-97   6:01         868,000           0  RC.EXE

which reports itself as

 IBM RC (Resource Compiler) Version 5.00.002 Dec 18 1997

and it is available from

  <ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/warpzilla/os2tk40rc.zip>

You can get LXLITE.EXE from

 <http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-search?key=lxlite&pushbutton=Search>

You can get OpenWatcom from

 <http://www.openwatcom.org>


Building
========

Use subversion to pull a copy of the source code distribution into your 
client workspace.  See

 <http://svn.netlabs.org/fm2>

for instructions on how to do this.

Build the release version with

  wmake

Build the debug version with

  wmake DEBUG=1

or

  set DEBUG=1
  wmake

The build outputs are:

  av2.exe
  databar.exe
  dirsize.exe
  eas.exe
  fm3.exe
  fm4.exe
  global.exe
  ini.exe
  killproc.exe
  sysinfo.exe
  undel.exe
  vcollect.exe
  vdir.exe
  viewinfs.exe
  vtree.exe

  dll\fm3dll.dll
  dll\fm3res.dll


  dll\fm3res.str

  dll\ipf\fm3.hlp

  internal\mkstr.exe

Release Packaging
=================

FM/2 is released as a WarpIN package.

The basic process is

  wmake wpi

See

 <http://svn.netlabs.org/fm2/wiki/WPIBuild>

for more details.


About FM/2
==========

FM2 was originally written by

  Mark Kimes
  <hectorplasmic@worldnet.att.net>

He has kindly allowed us to take over maintenance and support of FM/2 and to
release the program under the GNU GPL license.  I'm sure he would appreciate
a Thank You note for his generosity.


Support
=======

FM/2 is a Netlabs project.  The project URL is

 <http://svn.netlabs.org/fm2>

The user support mailing list is

  <mailto:fm2-user@netlabs.org>

Like all Netlabs mailing list, this is mirrored to gmane.

In addition the maintainers, monitor the comp.os.os2.programmer.misc 
newsgroup and others in the comp.os.os2.* hierarchy.

There is also an archived Yahoo group at

 http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fm2/

The list is closed to new posts, but contains some useful info.

If all else fails, you can always e-mail me directly at

Thanks and enjoy.
