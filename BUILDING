Building FM/2                               			02 Apr 2003
=============

This document explains how to build FM/2 from source.


Tools
=====

The following tools have been used to build binary distributions:

  IBM VisualAge C++ V3 with FP8
  IBM Developers Toolkit v4.5

Older versions of the Toolkit may work.  There are no known special setup requirements.


Building
========

Unzip the source code distribution to a work directory.  Be sure to preserve 
the directory tree.

Build the release version with:

  NMAKE

Build the debug version with:

  NMAKE DEBUG=1

The build outputs are:

  AV2.EXE
  DATABAR.EXE
  DIRSIZE.EXE
  EAS.EXE
  FM3.EXE
  FM4.EXE
  GLOBAL.EXE
  INI.EXE
  KILLPROC.EXE
  SYSINFO.EXE
  UNDEL.EXE
  VCOLLECT.EXE
  VDIR.EXE
  VIEWINFS.EXE
  VTREE.EXE

  FM3DLL.DLL
  FM3RES.DLL

  FM3.HLP


About FM/2
==========

FM2 was originally written by:

  Mark Kimes
  <hectorplasmic@worldnet.att.net>

He has kindly allowed me to take over maintenance and support of FM/2 and to
release the program under the GNU GPL license.  I'm sure he would appreciate
a Thank You note for his generosity.


Support
=======

Please address support questions and enhancement requests to:

  Steven H. Levine
  steve53@earthlink.net

I monitor the comp.os.os2.programmer.misc newsgroup and others in the
comp.os.os2.* hierarchy.


Thanks and enjoy.
