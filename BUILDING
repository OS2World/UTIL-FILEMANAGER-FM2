Building FM/2                               			14 Aug 2005
=============

This document explains how to build FM/2 from source.


Tools
=====

The following tools are currently used to build binary distributions:

  IBM VisualAge C++ V3.65 with FP2
  IBM Developers Toolkit v4.5
  lxlite LX compressor

Older versions of the Toolkit may work.  There are no known special setup requirements.

Not all versions of RC.EXE are created equal.  Currently, the best version to
use is:

 12-18-97   6:01         868,000           0  RC.EXE

which reports itself as:

 IBM RC (Resource Compiler) Version 5.00.002 Dec 18 1997

and it is available at:

  <ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/warpzilla/os2tk40rc.zip>

You can get LXLITE.EXE at:

 <http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-search?key=lxlite&pushbutton=Search>


Building
========

Unzip the source code distribution to a work directory.  Be sure to preserve 
the directory tree.

Build the release version with:

  nmake

Build the debug version with:

  NMAKE DEBUG=1

The build outputs are:

  av2.exe
  databar.exe
  dirsize.exe
  eas.exe
  fm3.exe
  fm4.exe
  global.exe
  ini.exe
  killproc.exe
  sysinfo.exe
  undel.exe
  vcollect.exe
  vdir.exe
  viewinfs.exe
  vtree.exe

  dll\fm3dll.dll
  dll\fm3res.dll


  dll\fm3res.str

  dll\ipf\fm3.hlp

  internal\mkstr.exe

About FM/2
==========

FM2 was originally written by:

  Mark Kimes
  <hectorplasmic@worldnet.att.net>

He has kindly allowed me to take over maintenance and support of FM/2 and to
release the program under the GNU GPL license.  I'm sure he would appreciate
a Thank You note for his generosity.


Support
=======

Please address support questions and enhancement requests to:

  Steven H. Levine
  steve53@earthlink.net

In addition to the fm2user Yahoo group, I monitor the 
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc newsgroup and others in the comp.os.os2.* 
hierarchy.


Thanks and enjoy.
