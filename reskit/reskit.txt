FM/2 Translation Toolkit

This Toolkit allows you to modify the strings and icons stored in FM3RES.STR
and FM3RES.DLL.  This allows you to translate FM/2 for other languages and
to replace FM/2's standard icons and bitmaps.

To use the Toolkit, create a work directory and unzip the reskit.zip to this
directory.  Be sure to preserve the directory structure in the zip file.  You
will also need a copy of FM3RES.DLL in the work directory.  Copy this file
from your FM/2 directory.

Modify the files in the Toolkit as described below and run the COMPILE
script to rebuild the selected files.

To rebuild FM3RES.DLL, you will need a copy of RC.EXE on your PATH and
appropriate OS/2 #include files.  RC and the #include files come with the
OS/2 developer's toolkit and various OS/2 compilers.  See the comments in
FM3STR.H for remarks about additions and insertions.

When making changes to FM3DLL.STR, FM3RES.RC or FM3RES.DLG, translate the
_text only_.  Do _not_ reorder, remove or create new lines in FM3DLL.STR.
Do not modify the odd-looking %%s, %%lu, etc. items in FM3DLL.STR. They are
used by the formatted print routines.

When replacing icons, make sure you provide an appropriate set of
resolutions.  When replacing bitmaps, make sure you to size the bitmap to fit
correctly in place of the original bitmap.

Do not alter any other files.  If you do not follow the above guidelines,
FM/2 may refuse to run correctly.

To get quick usage help, type

  COMPILE

at the command line.

To rebuild just FM3RES.STR, type

 COMPILE /S

at the command line.

To rebuild both FM3RES.DLL and FM3RES.STR, type

 COMPILE /B

at a command line.

After rebuilding, shut down FM/2 and copy the new files to the FM/2
program directory and restart FM/2.
