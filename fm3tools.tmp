;
;This file contains definitions for the FM/2 toolbar.
;
;Each tool button has four lines that describe it.  The first line is
;the help for the button.  The second line is the text for the button
;(internally defined tools have icons, and the text is ignored).  The
;third line is a number indicating flags associated with the button.
;A flag value of 1 means the button is droppable, 4 means invisible (5 both).
;The fourth line is the ID of the button (for internal commands only).
;Note Commands begin at ID 4001, so a button with ID 4001 would cause
;the first Command to be run and ID 4002 would run the second, and so on.
;You can use \r in the help string to break the help into multiple lines.
;
;I suggest that you keep a backup copy of this file...
